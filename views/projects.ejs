    <h1>My Personal Projects</h1>
    
    <h2>Senior Year Book</h2>
    <p>My project about investigating a topic chosen at the beginning of the year throughout the whole school year. My school was in French, so the project was also in French. The topic I chose was "What measures does the Rwandan government put in place to protect its citizens from cybercriminality?" We were only allowed to have one article from the internet, and all other investigations had to be made by interviewing people. At the end, we had to present the book in front of the professors, classmates, and parents. It was exciting and prepared us for the future.</p>

    <h2>Other Project</h2>
    <p>In the same senior year of high school, we had to fundraise for our senior year trip by hosting sports events, house parties, and concerts in Rwanda.</p>
