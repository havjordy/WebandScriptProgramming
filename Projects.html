    <h1>My personal projects</h1>
    <h2>Senior Year book</h2>
    <p>My project about investigating a topic chosen at the begining of the year thoughout the whole school year. My school was in French so the project. The topic i chose was "What measures does the Rwandan government put in place to protect it's citizen from Cybercriminality". We were only allowed to have one article from the internet and all other investigation had to be made by intrerviewing poeple. At the end, we had to present the book in front of the profs, classmates and parents. IT WAS EXCITING and it was preparing us for the furure</p>

    <h2>Other Project</h2>
    <p>In the same senior year in high school, we had to fundaraise ourselves our senior year trip by hosting sports events, house parties and concerts in Rwanda.</p>
